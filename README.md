# Minesweeper Game

This is a game in which you can win only if you are able to predict where the bombs will be, based on the numbers you uncover in every choice you make.

## Menu Interface

This is how the game interface looks. 
* Here you can choose how big the game will be (width / height), but keep in mind that the matrix will always be square,
* You can also choose how many bombs will be spawn in the game.

This is how it looks after you choose a few squares. They will tell you how many bombs are around them and based on that information you have to predict where the bombs will be to avoid them.

## Ups, looks like you stepped on a bomb

When you choose a square that has a bomb, then the game will end and you will have to start all over again.

## Help or cheat

Finally, if you can't finish the game because you always select a bomb, you can simply use the HELP button. It will highlight to you every location that contains a bomb. It is free to use but keep in mind that it will make the game way easier, so if you want a real challenge, avoid using it.
